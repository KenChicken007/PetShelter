        <p>Founded in 2013, ACF was created with the vision of assisting and empowering marginalized and neglected communities
            that society usually deems helpless, that are on the lowest rungs of the ladder of hope because their suffering has
            never been noticed to begin with. <br><br>

        ACF is rooted in the philosophy that the only fundamental test of what is real in life is a living beings ability to suffer.
        If a living being can feel suffering or enjoyment, it is our duty to ensure we minimize suffering as much as we can. <br><br>
             
        By expanding our worlds to include other living beings in it to live a life of dignity and freedom, will benefit human flourishing
        and positive growth of society overall.<br><br>
    
        Our facilities act like a special needs home, an orphanage, an old age home and a shelter for homeless, emotionally wounded animals. 
        <br><br>

        Over time, we have rescued thousands of animals and uncovered frighteningly high levels of abuse that inundate our society.
        We run educational and motivational programmes on empathy and compassion, based in ideas extracted from moral philosophy,
        the study of ethics, and psychology. <br><br>

        We hold several outreach programmes related to the betterment of animals by empowering people around them. <br><br>

        We aim to embody the empathy we try to spread through our actions and are attempting to take concrete steps to bring about
        protection for animals in the country. <br><br>

        We aim to encourage and inspire people to not just adopt this mission as a cause to love, but as a philosophy to adopt as a
        way of life. <br><br>

        The world is always better when we learn to coexist and we intend to work on the grassroots level of that change by inspiring
        those around us to be kind to those who cannot do anything for you in return, and to protect the most vulnerable in society.
        We are confident that the more this mindset is adopted, the more there will be a trickle-down effect of kindness, goodness,
        compassion, tolerance and acceptance in society as a whole.<br><br>

                The world belongs to all of us. To human and non-human animals. When we start perceiving the world as a shared reality,
                the world will start to become a better place for everyone. ACF’s goal is to show via example the truest form of
                empathy-to do for those who can never do anything for you in return. To help those who’s shoes you will never be in.
                And to care for anybody and everybody that ever needs help, no matter who they are.<br><br>
